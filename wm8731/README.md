Description
===========

Low-level library for the [Wolfson WM8731 audio codec]
(http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/products/codecs/WM8731/).

Status
======

This project is very early in the development process and is liable to change
dramatically as I wake up each day with a "new and improved" way to do this or
that...

This library may have dependencies on the STM32F2 library, which I will attempt
to break as I find the time.

Documentation
=============

None yet... :-)

There is an example in the stm32f2 library's "examples/". It's my test-bed
application. It's very much a work in progress, and probably doesn't work at the
moment. But it should give you a feeling for this library.
