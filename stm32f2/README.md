Description
===========

Low-level library for [ST Microelectronics STM32F2xx series microcontrollers]
(http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/subclass/1520.jsp).

Status
======

This project is very early in the development process and is liable to change
dramatically as I wake up each day with a "new and improved" way to do this or
that...

This library will likely grow to support the [STM32F4xx series microcontrollers]
(http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/subclass/1521.jsp), since the F4 series is
pin-compatible with the F2 series and also supports DSP and floating point
instructions (very handy for audio and radio projects!).

Documentation
=============

None yet... :-)

There is one example in "examples/". It's my test-bed application. It's very
much a work in progress, and probably doesn't work at the moment. But it should
give you a feeling for the library and the extent of hardware peripheral
support.
