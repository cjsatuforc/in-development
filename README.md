Description
===========

Schematics, circuit board designs, test/prototyping code
for stuff I'm working on. Once these evolve to a full-
blown project, they'll get promoted to their own
repositories. But there may still be interesting and
useful tidbits lurking within these files...

radio/circuit-boards
--------------------

Contains three radio-frequency circuit board designs:

* bpf-0805-4pc-breakout: 2.4 GHz band-pass filter using Johanson or TDK SAW filter.
* saw-dcc6e-breakout: 315 or 433 MHz band-pass filter using EPCOS SAW filters.
* tc1-1-13-breakout: transformer-based balun using the Mini-Circuits TC1-1-13M.
